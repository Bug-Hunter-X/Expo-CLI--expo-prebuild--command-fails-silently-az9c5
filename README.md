# Expo CLI `expo prebuild` Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI's `expo prebuild` command fails without providing a useful error message.  The project builds and runs correctly using `expo start`, but `expo prebuild` consistently fails.  This prevents deployment using methods that rely on the prebuild process. 

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Attempt to run `expo prebuild`.  The command will fail without a clear indication of the problem.

## Potential Solutions

The solution provided involves a detailed investigation to pinpoint the root cause. This may involve checking logs, analyzing dependencies, and comparing the build process of `expo start` vs `expo prebuild` to find differences. A potential solution may also involve upgrading Expo or related packages.

## Troubleshooting

- Check the Expo CLI logs for any additional information that might have been omitted from the standard output.
- Ensure all dependencies are up to date.
- Try creating a minimal reproducible example to isolate the issue. 
- Compare the `expo start` and `expo prebuild` processes for any discrepancies in how the project is built.

This issue highlights the importance of robust error handling and informative error messages in CLI tools.
