The root cause was determined to be an incompatibility between a specific version of a third-party library and the prebuild process used by Expo. Upgrading the library to the latest version resolved the issue.  While the initial error message from `expo prebuild` was unhelpful, checking the detailed logs provided more insight into the problem. 

To resolve this, make sure you are using the latest versions of all dependencies:

```bash
npm update
```

If this doesn't resolve the issue, examine the logs produced by `expo prebuild` for any error messages from specific libraries.  This can help you focus on the specific dependency causing conflicts.  The use of a debugging tool such as `console.log` statements may be useful to check the build process during `expo prebuild` to see where it may be failing.
