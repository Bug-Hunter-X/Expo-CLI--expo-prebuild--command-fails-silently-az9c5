While developing an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error related to the `expo prebuild` command.  The error message was vague and unhelpful, simply stating that the prebuild process failed without specifics. My project was relatively simple and had no apparent issues with dependencies or configurations. I tried running `expo prebuild` multiple times, clearing the cache (`expo start --clear`), and even reinstalling node modules, but the issue persisted. The project built and ran correctly using `expo start`, but the prebuild process, necessary for certain deployment methods, consistently failed.
